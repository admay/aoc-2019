My solutions to Advent of Code 2019
-----------------------------------

I usually burn out on these kinds of things pretty quickly.
I'm using this to try to learn more about Rust though.
Specifically, I'd like to get more comfortable working with
the Rust type system and ownership model. I've heard it has
a pretty steep learning curve, and that's proving to be true
so far. So did Clojure though, and I managed to make that work.
